Iceland used to be a place American tourists stopped off on their way to Europe. It was the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic, but nobody stayed for more than a day or two. Today it is one of the world’s fastest-growing travel destinations. In the last five years, visitor numbers have doubled. And that rise is due to continue as new hotels are built, budget airlines open up routes and new attractions open. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can expect.
Northern Lights or
endless nights
Due to its geographical position at the top of the globe, summer and winter are very different here. In June, there is virtually no nighttime, and in December virtually no day. People mostly visit in the summer because of the long days and better weather but increasingly people are coming in winter to see the breathtaking Northern Lights. Tour guides take you on snowmobiles to areas with no light pollution to increase your chance of seeing the phenomenon. But bring warm clothes, it can be freezing! In the summer, enjoy near-endless daylight – why not go whale-watching at midnight?
Hot pots everywhere
There are 30 active volcanoes here, many of them under thick ice. There are natural hot springs
